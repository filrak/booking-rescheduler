to-do:

- don't book if there is already an appointment at that time
- don't book if the time is not in the range 8:00 - 12:00


How to treat rescheduling
- First ask about preferences, then suggest the exact times that were prefered if they are available or the next available time as close to preffered as possible.
- If the person cannot make it in any available time, try to reschedule one of the existing visits.
